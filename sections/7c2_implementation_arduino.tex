\subsubsection{Areas for Improvement}

In our quest to refine the Arduino locker system prototype,
 it's crucial to address specific areas that can benefit from enhancements.
  This section will focus on improving log handling and enhancing security measures.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Log Handling}:\\
    The current log handling mechanism lacks comprehensive remote logging capabilities. Implementing remote logging would enable logs to be sent to an admin or remote server, improving maintenance and oversight of system activities.
    \item \textbf{Security Enhancement}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security measures, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption, need enhancement to safeguard sensitive information.
        \item Implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with both a Personal Identification Number (PIN) and Near Field Communication (NFC) chip would enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
